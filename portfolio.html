            <h3>Project on CNN</h3>
            <p>
               In this project, I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based object annotation system. The objective was to accurately detect and annotate objects within images using deep learning techniques. Object annotation is a critical task in computer vision applications, and my project aimed to create a robust and efficient solution.

            <h3>Project on Rain Alarm Sensor</h3>
            <p>
               In this project I made a rain alarm sensor using arduimo. The Rain Alarm project is an Arduino-based weather monitoring system designed to detect rain and alert users in real-time. The objective of this project was to create a low-cost and efficient solution for monitoring rainfall, which can be valuable for various applications, including agriculture and home automation.
